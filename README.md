# Deans List Extraction

This is Python script that extracts the names and majors of students from a university's Dean's List and writes that data into a CSV file.

It utilized 'requests' and 'beautifulSoup' to gather and parse the data. 

A total of 2,360 students were extracted when I originally used this script.
